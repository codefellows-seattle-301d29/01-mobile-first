# Mobile First Design

**Author**: Brian Bixby and Ahmed Ali
**Version**: 2.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Ahmed and Brian created this application as an exercise in mobile first responsive design and website fundamentals including: site organization, meta-tags and basic CSS styling. Our site focuses on creating a responsive site for small mobile devices and a working desktop version as well.
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
For a user to create a similar site they would first need to organize their project by creating and linking all of their stylesheets and relevant icons and images. From here they would need to add the proper viewport meta tag and syle the site in a responsive manner.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
Our application utilizes HTML, CSS and icons from Icomoon. We also leaned heavily on Github and Node's Live Server during the development process.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:
