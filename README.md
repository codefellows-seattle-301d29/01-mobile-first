# Mobile-First

**Author**: Ryan & Andrii
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
<!-- We are building this blog page to be responsive so the hamburger menu appears on a mobile platform and does not appear on a desktop platform as well as to showcase our skills. -->

## Getting Started
<!-- First, the user must fork this repository. Once the repo is forked, the user must clone their new repo on to their machine. From there, the user can open the page using index.html or line-server. -->

## Architecture
<!-- We used HTML & CSS, also using normalize to reset the browsers settings and iconomoon for the icons. We sectioned the CSS files into base, icons, layout, and modules. -->

## Change Log
<!-- 01-09-2018 2:00pm - Application is responsive based on browser size, still working on CSS features and hover. 
	 01-10-2018 9:00am - Application is functioning properly and responsive based on window size. -->

## Credits and Collaborations
<!-- Normalize CSS reset and iconomoon -->
