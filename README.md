# Project Name

**Author**: Melanie & Alex
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- We want to build a user-friendly responsive application to showcase content and our skills. -->

## Getting Started
<!-- The user must first fork this repository. Once the repo is forked, the user must clone their new repo onto their machine. From there, the user can open the site using the index.html or using live-server.-->

## Architecture
<!-- We used only HTML & CSS, using Normalize to reset the browser settings and Iconomoon for icons. We sectioned our CSS files into three sections: base, layout, and modules. -->

## Change Log
<!-- 01-09-2018 1:39 PM PST - Application is fully functional. Hover functionality is working correctly.

## Credits and Collaborations
<!-- Normalize CSS reset and Iconomoon. -->
